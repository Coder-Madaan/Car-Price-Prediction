# Car Price Predictor

## Overview

This project is a Car Price Predictor application that estimates the price of a car based on various features. The prediction model is built using the Random Forest algorithm. The application involves data cleaning and preprocessing, and evaluates the model's performance using R² score and efficiency metrics. The frontend is designed using HTML and CSS, and it interacts with the backend model via Flask. The trained model is saved and loaded using the Pickle module.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes Random Forest algorithm for car price prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Involves data cleaning, handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated using R² score to determine the model's accuracy and efficiency.
- **Frontend Interface:** Developed with HTML and CSS for a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend Integration:** Flask is used to connect the frontend with the machine learning model.
- **Model Persistence:** The trained model is serialized using the Pickle module for easy loading and prediction.
